This project is a coin flip game made for coding practice.
The code requests the user to input how many times they would like to have the coin flipped.
The code then "flips a coin" the input number of times, and prints each result as heads or tails.
Then, the total of heads and tails is printed.
The user is then asked if they would like to play again.

I need to revise the code so that if the user inputs 'y' and wants to play again, it does not display invalid entry, despite playing again.
